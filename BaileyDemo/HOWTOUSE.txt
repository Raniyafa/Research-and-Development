Greetings, it's Bailey here, so you wanna go into the server folder in the root dir
once there, use a terminal to run node index.js, you should get a message that the server is running
after that you need to open two game windows with Android studio, to do this click the "Run 'Desktop' with Coverage"
button, and then click the normal play button.

The server connection only starts when the player presses the enter lobby button.

express, node.js and socket.io required

(npm install express)
(npm install socket.io)
